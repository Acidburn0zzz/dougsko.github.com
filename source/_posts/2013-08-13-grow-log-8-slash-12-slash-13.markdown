Yesterday, I added some nutrients to the water.  I'm using the Flora
Grow nutrient system, which consists of three parts, Gro, Bloom, and
Micro.  I added 4 tsp of each to the reservoir.  

The cucumber plant has shot up pretty quickly.  It's already about an an
inch and a half tall.  Since it was doing so well, I moved it to its own
pot.

Not sure what these are, but they're also growing pretty quickly.
