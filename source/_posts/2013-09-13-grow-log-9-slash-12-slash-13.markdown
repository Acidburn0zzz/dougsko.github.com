The garden has been moved to a new spot and I picked up a new reservoir
that holds ten more gallons and is much more sturdy.

I topped the basil plant so it would start growing out instead of just
up.  You can see how this made the plant split, and once it grows out a
bit more, I'll top each of the two main stems in order to make it branch
out again.

The cucumber plant is starting to grow flowers!

While this mystery plant has been growing extremely slowly compared to
the others, it has been making some noticible progress lately.

The two pepper plants are doing great.  It's really obvious that they
are doing much better than they would have under the old lighting
system.
