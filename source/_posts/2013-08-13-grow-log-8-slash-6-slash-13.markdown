I picked up the following seeds to grow in this garden:

- Cucumbers
- Collard greens
- Parsley
- Cilantro
- Rosemary
- Eggplant
- Basil
- Dill
- Broccoli
- Brussels Sprouts

I planted the seeds in 1/2" rockwool cubes and then placed all the cubes
in two flower pots with some expanded clay pellets on the bottom.  I
covered the pots lightly with some plastic wrap in order to increase the
humidity.
