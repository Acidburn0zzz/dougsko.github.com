With the table and lights completed, what I needed next were some drain
fittings.  One fitting is connected to the water pump and the other acts
as an overflow guard.  The overflow tube limits how deep the water can
get in the flood table, protecting you from flooding your house.  I used
a 1-3/8" spade bit to drill the holes in the flood table for the
fittings.  Once they were in place, I added the tubing, and a 20 gallon
storage container to act as the reservoir.

You'll notice I started some seeds in rockwool cubes and placed then on
the table.
