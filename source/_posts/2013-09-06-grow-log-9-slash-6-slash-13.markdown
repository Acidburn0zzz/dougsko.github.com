I swapped out the two flood lights for a 4', four bulb, T5 fixture.  It
throws twice the lumens and provides much better overall coverage on the
table.  This should greatly reduce dark spots and stretching.

The fixture is hanging from ratcheting pulleys, which allow me to raise
and lower the lights very easily.
