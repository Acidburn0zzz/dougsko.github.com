I didn't label my plants so I actually have no idea what's what yet.
Two cubes have just barely began to sprout.  I stacked their pots on top
of other pots in order to get them closer to the light.  The lights are
on 18 hours a day.  I also added some foil to the lights to act as
reflectors until I come up with a more permanant solution.
